    is about a Greek noble man who fell in love with Smilax. Smilax was a beautiful shepardess. The gods forbid this marriage between Smilax and Crocus so Crocus killed himself.
    Smilax cried so much from the loss that the Goddess Flora decided to turn them both into flowers to prevent her from being so sad.
    She tured Smilax into a vine and Crocus into the Crocus flower, as a result the Crocus flowers and vines are connected
    and used in wedding decorations to symbolize love. The meaning of these flowers are especially strong in Greek and Egyptian culture.
    In Greek culture it is a symbol of eternal love. In Egyptian culture these flowers were actually used to prevent the fumes from drinks that
    had alcohol by spraying these flowers over the cups. In addition, the Romans loved the aroma of the flower that they used it in their homes and on themselves
    like perfume and cologne.<br><br>
